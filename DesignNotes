4 Factions
Ruserica - Relies on using direct, elite, battle-advantaged strategies (AP, Stopping Power, Blitz) (Weak to Jesud as elite units get overwhelmed)
Doman - Relies on using indirect, ranged, synergystic strategies (Ranged, Morale, Blitz) (Weak to Ruserica as they can punch through defenses)
Jesud - Relies on using cheap, massed, battle-advantaged strategies (AP, Stopping Power, Infiltrate) (Weak to Polsis as they can stop the horde)
Polsis - Relies on using defensive, reactionary, and attrition-based strategies (Repair, Ranged, Morale) (Weak to Doman as they can outshoot with ranged)

Ways to keep things from snowballing:
-Extra card draw for destroyed cities?
-Morale tokens for destroyed cities?
